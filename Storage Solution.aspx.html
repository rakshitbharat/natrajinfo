<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">1. Volume Expansion</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dynamic Volume Expansion is a key solution for enterprises and heavy data users who require large amounts of storage
 with the option of easy growth. By incorporating a 10GbE switch, businesses have the flexibility to add up to eight 
 target devices in a single NAS stack.

<br />
<br />
<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">2. Daisy-Chaining</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With daisy chaining, users now have the ability to cost effectively increase their storage volume while maintaining 
fast transfers. To set up a daisy chain, one master NAS unit is installed as a controller with up to four DAS linked 
as slaves. SAS cables are then used to link the units together in order to ensure rapid speeds. The ability to reach 
tremendous capacities while saving nearly 30% on hardware costs (versus traditional storage architecture) is something 
truly groundbreaking in the industry.
<br />
<br />
<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">3. Stackable</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NAS are well prepared for new data and performance demands, with future-looking designs that meet even the most 
demanding scenarios. With both RAID and iSCSI expansion available in a single NAS, adding more or larger disks to 
expand your available data capacity is easy. Although this is a very useful and important function, users are still 
limited by the capacity of their NAS. So by stacking your NAS, users are able to extra NAS and increase their 
capacity exponentially, therefore giving you a revolutionary scale of adaptability.

<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">1. VMware ESXi 5.5 Certified</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Business users can utilize their NAS together with VMware® servers to build virtual infrastructure and create virtual 
machines (VMs). On virtual machines, different operating systems can be set up and numerous applications can be 
installed on each OS so as to carry out various tasks. A Thecus NAS with a VMware® server will form a unified pool of 
resources that can be used by VMs to run applications. Compared with traditional single servers with single sets of 
applications models, virtual infrastructures significantly reduce operating costs, lower electricity consumption, and 
increase overall hardware resource utilization.

<br />
<br />
<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">2. VMware ESXi VAAI</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Users of popular virtualization hypervisor, ESXI, can now appreciate full support for VAAI. vSphere storage APIs for 
Array Integration allows storage operations in the virtualization platform to be offloaded to networked storage, 
improving overall performance of the Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
<br />
<br />
<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">3. Citrix Ready</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Citrix® XenServer™ is the only enterprise-class, cloud-proven server virtualization platform that delivers critical 
features such as live migration and centralized multi-server management at no cost. Thecus Citrix Ready NAS have all 
passed the Citrix verification process.
<br />
<br />

<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">4. Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Designed for line-of-business and mission-critical applications, the Certified for Windows Server 2008 R2 logo 
demonstrates that Thecus enterprise solution meets Microsoft's highest technical bar for stability, security, 
reliability, availability, Windows fundamentals, and platform compatibility.
<br />
<br />

<h4><b style="color:#404d8d;">5. iSCSI Thin Provisioning</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
iSCSI Thin Provisioning allows administrators to create up to 5 iSCSI Thin-Provision targets under one iSCSI 
Thin-Provision volume. These iSCSI targets will then share physical storage space from the iSCSI Thin-Provision 
volume. iSCSI Thin-Provisioning prevents administrators from over-provisioning physical storage space before it is 
actually needed, thus greatly reducing capital spending on storage for businesses of all scales.
